#. or a valid timezone string (America/New_York). See https://www.php.net/manual/en/timezones.php
#. for all timezone strings currently supported by PHP.
#. Important: When a previous timezone string, like `Europe/Kiev`, has been superseded by an
#. updated one, like `Europe/Kyiv`, as a rule of thumb, the **old** timezone name should be used
#. in the "translation" to allow for the default timezone setting to be PHP cross-version compatible,
#. as old timezone names will be recognized in new PHP versions, while new timezone names cannot
#. be recognized in old PHP versions.
#. To verify which timezone strings are available in the _oldest_ PHP version supported, you can
#. use https://3v4l.org/6YQAt#v5.6.20 and replace the "BR" (Brazil) in the code line with the
#. country code for which you want to look up the supported timezone names.
